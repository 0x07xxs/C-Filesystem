# C-Filesystem
Just a simple file system I made for linux based machines. It is meant to impliment CRUD which is create, read, update and delete I made this to get myself more familiarized to C++. Feel free to use it, change it or use it for reference hope this helps. 

Documentation

"c" - creates a file you have to specify a name for your file
"r" - read a file you have to specify the file to read
"u" - update the file you want to specify along with the contents you want to input in that file
"d" - deletes the file you specify with a text prompt making sure if you want to delete it just in case (mistakes happen)
